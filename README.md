<Useful javascript codes>
Some codes are completely made by me,while some might be made by me but modyfied by ChatGPT.If a javascript code wasn't made by me,I would state it.

To use the javascript codes in this page,simply go to enter javascript:(place the code here)  in the website adress bar.You can also download javascript injectors to do this.I recommend using the extension "Scripty".I also upload some javascript codes there.

See this image below to know how the extension looks like:
